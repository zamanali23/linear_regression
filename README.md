Project Objective: By predicting the bike rental demand in advance from weather forcast, Bike rental company position the bike according to customersâ€™ demand resulting in increase in the bike utilization.

Quantifiable Results: We could predict the Bike rentals resulting in 95% acccuracy and 135% increase in Bike utilization.

Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration
